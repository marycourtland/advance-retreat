Games For Our Future 2019

We have huge challenge ahead of of us to get our carbon emissions under control. But I find that it's easy to get demotivated by the immensity of it. How do we stay energized?

This game looks at the balance between taking care of yourself and contributing to this societal goal. You can take some actions to advance the project (planting trees, building wind turbines). Each action will decrease your energy level. Restore yourself by retreating to nature, represented by birdsong.

I was inspired by a lot of the researchers at the game jam, especially:

- Sarah Chase, nature connectedness
- Rick Thomas, collaboration in outdoor games
